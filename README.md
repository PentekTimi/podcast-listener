The goal of the project was to create a performant app while getting familiar with the Vue.js framework. Before using the new Compositions API I wanted to understand the traditional way of building Vue components with the Options API.

# Tech Stack

- Vue3 - built with Vue 3 framework and used Options API. The development environment was configured using Vite. Vue related libraries/plugins used in this project:
  - Vue Router - router to navigate the web app
  - Vee Validate - library to validate forms
  - Pinia - store library and state management framework for the app
  - Vue i18n - internationalisation plugin
  - Vite PWA - Progressive Web App (PWA) plugin for Vite
- Firebase - backend solution for the project. Firebase hosts the database for the application and manages authentication.
- Tailwind CSS
- Nprogress.js - library that shows the progress bar while the page is being loaded
- Howler.js - audio library
