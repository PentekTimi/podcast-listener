<h2>Introduction</h2>

Podcast listener application built with Vue, Firebase and Pinia for state management. <br>
Some of the functionalities developed are user authentication, file uploading, audio playback, internalisation, commenting, editing, and deleting files.

The goal of the project was to create a performant app while getting familiar with the Vue.js framework. Before using the new Compositions API I wanted to understand the traditional way of building Vue components with the Options API.
